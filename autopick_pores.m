% autopick_pores
%
% Function to isolate putative NPC structures from the nuclear envelope of
% cells in localisation microscopy data
%
% INPUT:
%   molecules data from impy in the form of a binDat
%   envelope vector (optional)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   envelope_X, envelope_Y - the original user input
%   pores - positions of structures in the envelope and vectors for align
%
% NOTE:
%   At some point in the future it would be nice to extend the envelope
%   interpolation to utilise a spline defined by the surface normals. At
%   the moment this is a linear interpolation between the vertices of the
%   user input.
